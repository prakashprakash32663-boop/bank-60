An SRS document for a bank management system defines functional requirements (customer login, balance inquiries, fund transfers, checkbook requests, and account management) and non-functional requirements (security, reliability, and performance) to facilitate online or ATM-based transactions. Key components include user authentication, data storage, and system interfaces for customers and bank staff.
